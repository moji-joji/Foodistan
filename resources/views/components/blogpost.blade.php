        <p class="mb-6 lead lh-lg text-muted">Well, the Ice cream diet promises slimming down and a
            healthier body while involving ice cream in the daily diet. The original concept of this diet
            comes from a book written by a nutritionist named Holly McCord in 2002.</p>
        <p class="mb-6 lead lh-lg text-muted">But if that were the case, then how and why would ice creams
            develop such a bad reputation in regard to calories, in the first place? That’sThat’s because,
            in reality, ice cream still possesses as many calories as mentioned in the earlier sections of
            this article.</p>
        <p class="lead lh-lg text-muted">However, what still makes this diet effective is the general
            reduction in daily calorie intake. In the bigger picture, the Ice cream asks you to reduce the
            calories you consume each day (preferably to 1250). With this, you can add in your favorite food
            like ice cream worth 250 calories. Hence, the total calories you consume are no more than 1500.
            Thus, helping you reduce weight along with making it fun.</p>
